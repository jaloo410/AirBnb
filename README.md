## Introduction

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the Airbnb market in Paris. By examining factors such as pricing, host growth, and the effect of regulations, we aim to understand the dynamics and trends within the Parisian Airbnb landscape.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of Airbnb listings in Paris. The dataset includes information such as listing prices, host details, neighborhood information, and other relevant attributes. The specific source and version of the dataset used in this analysis is from Maven Analytics Playground "www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground" Airbnb Listings & Reviews.

## Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook (`Airbnb.ipynb`) contains the code and detailed explanations for the analysis performed. The main aspects covered in the analysis include:

- Exploring the relationship between listing price and the number of accommodates in the Elysée neighborhood.
- Analyzing the growth of new Airbnb hosts in Paris over time.
- Investigating the average Airbnb price in Paris over time.
- Examining the impact of regulations introduced in 2015 on the number of new hosts and average prices.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Airbnb.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the notebook cells in sequential order to execute the code and generate the analysis results.

## Results

The analysis provides several key findings:

- In the Elysée neighborhood, listings with higher accommodation capacities tend to have higher average prices.
- The number of new Airbnb hosts in Paris has grown steadily over the years, with a notable increase in recent years.
- The average Airbnb price in Paris has shown an upward trend, particularly in the later years of the analysis.
- The introduction of regulations in 2015 appears to have had an impact on the Airbnb market, leading to a decrease in the number of new hosts and an increase in average prices.
